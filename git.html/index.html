   <u><h1><center>Git</center></h1></u>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes to files, and manage project history. It keeps track of all the changes made to files, enabling you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean history of changes. Git is widely used in software development for managing source code.</p><br>
  <u> <h2>The 3 stages in Git:</h2></u>

<p>Git has a three-stage process for managing changes to files:<br>
  <b>  1. Working Directory (Working Tree)</b> What it is: The working directory is the directory where your project files reside on your local machine. It’s where you make changes to files, such as editing, adding, or deleting files. What happens here: When you edit or create files in your project, these files are considered to be in the working directory. Git doesn’t track these changes until they are added to the staging area. Example: You edit a file called index.html in your project directory.
  <b>  2. Staging Area (Index) What it is</b>: The staging area is a temporary area where you place changes you want to commit. It's like a holding area for changes that will become part of the next commit. You decide which changes should be included in the commit by adding them to the staging area. What happens here: You use git add to stage the changes in the files that you want to commit. This allows you to selectively commit changes. Example: You make edits to index.html and style.css. After editing, you run git add index.html to stage the changes for the next commit.
   <b> 3. Git Repository (Local Repository)</b> What it is: The Git repository is where all the committed history of your project is stored. Once you commit staged changes, they are saved in the Git repository. The repository keeps track of the entire history of the project. What happens here: You use git commit to take the changes from the staging area and save them to the repository’s history. Each commit creates a snapshot of the project at that point in time. Example: After staging the changes, you run git commit -m "Updated the homepage" to commit the staged changes to the local repository.</p><br>

  <u> <h2>GitHub</h2></u>
<p>GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It is built around Git, a distributed version control system, but it adds extra functionality to improve collaboration and project management. GitHub is widely used for version control and collaboration, especially in open-source projects. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, tracking issues, and reviewing code.</p>
